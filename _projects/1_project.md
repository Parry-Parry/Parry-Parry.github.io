This [project]() is an extension of [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier) for arbitrary body text manipulation. By using terrier you have access to lexical statistics aswell as the use of more general retrieval pipelines. The main focus of the summary component is sentence wise summary both using abstractive summary and sentence salience ranking to produce summarized text. The generative component aims to allow the use of large language models to perform arbitrary manipulation of text whilst being able to use multiple components that are availible in a corpus such as titles or topics.
