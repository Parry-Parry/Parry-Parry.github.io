This [project](https://github.com/Parry-Parry/LightChain) exists as I don't like what is going on under the hood in langchain, it isn't made for computer scientists. As such following [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier) I have made a lightweight chain-of-thought package with composable operators such that creating pipelines for multi-hop reasoning is intuitive.
