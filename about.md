title: About

I am a 2nd year PhD Candidate within the Information Retrieval group at the University of Glasgow under Dr Debasis Ganguly & Dr Sean MacAvaney. My interests mainly lie within NLP and Information Retrieval. Recently, I have been attacking retrieval models and doing evil things with LLMs.

Previously I completed my undergraduate degree in Computing Science with specialization in Data Management, my main focus was in sequence to sequence learning applied to code translation and how standard code to text datasets could be augmented to create beginner friendly translations. I have enjoyed both Graphic Design and teaching in the past. I provided graphics for DigitalSkillsEducation Scotland and the University of Edinburgh. From its inception, I was the longest-attending member of CoderDojo Scotland (for 5 years). I then voluntarily and professionally taught Computing Science in disadvantaged areas.
