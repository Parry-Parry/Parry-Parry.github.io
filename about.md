title: About

I am a 2nd year PhD Candidate within the Information Retrieval group at the University of Glasgow under Dr Debasis Ganguly & Dr Sean MacAvaney. My interests mainly lie within NLP and Information Retrieval. Recently, I have been training retrieval models and doing evil things with LLMs.

Previously I completed my undergraduate degree in Computing Science with specialization in Data Management, my main focus was in sequence to sequence learning applied to code translation and how standard code to text datasets could be augmented to create beginner friendly translations. I have enjoyed both Graphic Design and teaching in the past. I enjoy playing Bass and killing braincells in Team Fortress 2.
