I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) working within the IR group. I am supervised by [Dr Debasis Ganguly](https://gdebasis.github.io/) and [Dr Sean MacAvaney](https://macavaney.us/). My research interests are primarily in Information Retrieval. Before my PhD I completed my honours degree in Computer Science at Glasgow.

My thesis is focused on inducing control over neural models without post-hoc constraint and how we can incorporate broader features in semantic interactions. A relatively up to date CV can be found [here](https://parry-parry.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf). Reach out on Twitter or by email if you want to chat about research or code. I'm generally interested in collaborations centred around robustness of neural systems under adversarial settings and semi-supervised signals in NLP.
