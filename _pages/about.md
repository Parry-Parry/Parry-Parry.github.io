I am a 1st year PhD Candidate within the Information Retrieval group at the University of Glasgow under Dr Debasis Ganguly & Dr Sean MacAvaney. My work lies within adversarial and efficient training of models. My interests mainly lie within NLP and Information Retrieval. Interested in privacy preserving uses of NLP, specifically data pre-processing and probabilistic approaches to increase adversarial robustness. 

Previously I completed my undergraduate degree in Computing Science with specialization in Data Management, my main focus was in sequence to sequence learning applied to code translation and how standard code to text datasets could be augmented to create beginner friendly translations. I have enjoyed both Graphic Design and teaching in the past. I provided graphics for DigitalSkillsEducation Scotland and Edinburgh University. From its inception, I was the longest-attending member of CoderDojo Scotland (for 5 years). I then voluntarily and professionally taught Computing Science in disadvantaged areas.
