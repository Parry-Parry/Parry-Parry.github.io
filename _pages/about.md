I am a 2nd year Phd Candidate in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). My research interests are broadly in natural language processing and specifically information retrieval. My research is focused on inducing control over neural models without post-hoc constraint and how we can incorporate broader features in semantic interactions.
