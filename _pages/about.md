I am a 2nd year Phd Candidate at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) working within the IR group. I am supervised by [Dr Debasis Ganguly](https://gdebasis.github.io/) and [Dr Sean MacAvaney](https://macavaney.us/). My research interests are broadly in natural language processing and specifically neural information retrieval. Before my PhD I did my undergraduate in Computer Science at Glasgow and worked as a graphic designer of educational materials aswell as a volunteer at programming classes.

My thesis is focused on inducing control over neural models without post-hoc constraint and how we can incorporate broader features in semantic interactions. A relatively up to date CV can be found [here](https://parry-parry.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf). Reach out on Twitter or email if you want to chat about research or code. I'm generally interested in robustness of neural systems under adversarial settings and semi-supervised signals in NLP in collaborations.
